BRIDL offers a simple, safe, and transparent sales experience, streamlining the process of trading elite competition horses and creating new industry standards with its top-tier investment and valorization program.

Bridl was founded in 2020, in response to the traditional market's complexities and lack of transparency. As the equestrian industry evolved, it recognized the need for a reliable, streamlined platform to simplify the online services for horse owners. Bridl is driven by a vision to provide a trustworthy online service where every transaction is clear, secure, and efficient. By leveraging advanced technology and a deep understanding of the equestrian world, we aim to bring confidence and ease to every horse service experience.
